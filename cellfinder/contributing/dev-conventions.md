# Development conventions

## Pull requests

In all cases, please submit code to the main repository via a pull request. The developers recommend, and adhere, to the following conventions:
- please submit _draft_ pull requests as early as possible (you can still push to the branch once submitted) to allow discussion.
- one approval of a PR (by a repo owner) is enough for it to be merged
- unless someone approves the PR with optional comments, the PR is immediately merged by the approving reviewer.
- please merge via "Squash and Merge" on GitHub to maintain a clean commit history.
- if you don't mind who reviews the PR, you can ask for review from the [GH team](https://github.com/orgs/brainglobe/teams/ucl-rsdg) 
- ask for a review from someone specific if you think they would be a particularly suited reviewer (possibly noting why they are suited on the PR description)

## Formatting

`cellfinder` uses [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/), [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) and [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to ensure a consistent code style. You may need to run `pre-commit install` prior to working on the code to ensure that these tests are run on each commit if you haven't [installed as `[dev]`](https://docs.brainglobe.info/cellfinder/contributing/dev-install).

To check your code before committing, please run:

- for staged files
```python
pre-commit run
```

- for all files in the repository
```python
pre-commit run -a
```

## Testing

`cellfinder` uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) for testing. Please try to ensure that all functions are tested in `tests/tests/test_unit` and all workflows/command-line tools are tested in `tests/tests/test_integration`.

Some tests may take a long time \(e.g. those requiring tensorflow if you don't have a GPU\). These tests should be marked with `@pytest.mark.slow`, e.g.:

```python
import pytest
@pytest.mark.slow
def test_something_slow():
    slow_result = run_slow_processes()
    assert slow_result == expected_slow_thing
```

During development, these "slow" tests can be skipped by running `pytest -m "not slow"`.

## Travis

All commits & pull requests will be build by [GitHub actions](https://github.com/brainglobe/cellfinder/actions). To ensure there are no issues, please check that it builds: `pip install .` and run all of the tests: `pytest` before committing changes.

## Dependencies

The code in the cellfinder repository should be primarily the analysis of whole-brain microscopy images.  Other changes should be added to the relevant repository:

* **Cell detection algorithm**: [cellfinder-core](https://github.com/BrainGlobe/cellfinder-core)
* **Regstration:** [brainreg](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainreg)for cell detection.
* **Image data IO:** [imio](https://github.com/adamltyson/imio)
* **General imaging processing \(and other\) tools:**  [imlib](https://github.com/adamltyson/imlib).

## File paths

All file paths should be defined in `cellfinder.tools.prep.Paths`. Any intermediate file paths, \(i.e. those which are not of interest to the typical end user\) should be prefixed with `tmp__`. These should then be cleaned up as soon as possible after generation.

## Versioning

Versioning is taken care of using [bump2version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version). By using the `bump2version` command, new versions are incremented, a git tag is made, and when pushed to the remote repository, that version will be deployed to PyPI. Usage is as follows:

* Bump to new patch version \(e.g. `1.0.0` to `1.0.1-rc0`\): `bump2version patch`
* Bump to new minor version \(e.g. `1.0.0` to `1.1.0-rc0`\): `bump2version minor`
* Bump to new major version \(e.g. `1.0.0` to `2.0.0-rc0`\): `bump2version major`
* Bump to new release candidate version \(e.g. `1.0.0-rc0` to `1.0.0-rc1`\): `bump2version rc`
* To create a new release version \(e.g. `1.0.0-rc0` to `1.0.0`\): `bump2version release`
